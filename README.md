Hello! This is our github repository from our final project.

The code is primarily in main.ipynb, although you can look at api_call.rb for some color on our api calls.

Our dataset comprises of data from the two csv files. The data is combined and cleaned in main.ipynb. You can just go through the cells sequentiall to process the data, run the models, and plot the graphs. Please reach out to burton.lyng-olsen@yale.edu or lily.lin@yale.edu with any questions or issues. Thank you!
